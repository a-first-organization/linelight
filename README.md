# LineLight
a programming language by a single person.

## How To Compile
use make. nah i'm joking, i'm gonna make the cmake soon, so don't use make yet, use cl.exe or clang-cl if you're on windows, gnu compiler collection for linux, and for people who wanna create the cmake and use make, JUST DO IT.

# Questions (that nobody asked but i'm here to answer)

## why did you make this?
it's a project of mine i wanna remake.

## is it hard?
i mean, compiling it might be hard considering i haven't even generated the cmake project yet

## should i use this?
only if you want to.

## where is the code? why is there only a readme in the main branch?
it's because every damn software wants a master branch instead of a main branch.
